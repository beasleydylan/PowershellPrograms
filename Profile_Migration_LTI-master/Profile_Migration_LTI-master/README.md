# Profile_Migration_LTI
This repo contains 4 main programs which will help automate a profile migration into an LTI rather than having to do everything manually. The first file ran will be "run_step_one.bat" which creates a scheduled task to run the file "connect_azure.ps1" upon the next user login. The batch file also start up the powershell script "chg_pass.ps1" which will ask for a prompt to change a users password(usually admin) and will join to a workgroup. Upon restarting the next powershell file "connect_azure.ps1" will bring up the prompt to sign into AAD, then will restart the computer. After this the user will login and then you will run the forensIT script which will download and launch the Profwiz.msi. Run through that installation and restart and the profile migration will be done!(Make sure to run all scripts as admin)
